Poor Security Practuces

- 1. The Web App Security group does not limit access to the Web Server from the outside/the internet
the will make it difficult to monitor traffic. Ideally Traffic should only be allowed on specfic ports 
and only via the Application load balancer.
- 2. The S3 bucket with the secrets recipes is not configured to encrypt the data stored their at rest.
this will allowed all accoiunt users to be able to read the secret recepies.
