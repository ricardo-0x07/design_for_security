# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
 - [regula](https://github.com/fugue/regula): is a tool that evaluates CloudFormation and Terraform infrastructure-as-code for potential 
 AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud security and compliance violations prior to deployment.
 - [cfripper](https://github.com/Skyscanner/cfripper): CFRipper is a Library and CLI security analyzer for AWS CloudFormation templates. 
 You can use CFRipper to prevent deploying insecure AWS resources into your Cloud environment. You can write your own compliance checks 
 by adding new custom plugins.
 - [Cloudsploit](https://cloudsploit.com/opensource): CloudSploit by Aqua is an open-source project designed to allow detection of security 
 risks in cloud infrastructure accounts, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Oracle Cloud 
 Infrastructure (OCI), and GitHub. These scripts are designed to return a series of potential misconfigurations and security risks.



### Example vulnerability
 - misconfigurations of aws account
 - misconfigurations of aws user roles
 - missing enryption at rest for storage resources

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
 - [Anchore](https://anchore.com/): Scan Container Images for Vulnerabilities from the Command Line
 - [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair): Clair is an open source project which provides a tool to monitor the security of your containers through 
 the static analysis 
 of vulnerabilities in appc and docker containers. 
 - [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Scanner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as 
 for configuration issues


### Example vulnerability
 - Known os version specific security issues
 - Detecting know vulrenbility based on a database of same
 - Detecting errant software like viruses and malware

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
 - [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/): AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
 - [AWS Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/): Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance 
 of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
 - [AWS GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/): Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS accounts and workloads for 
 malicious activity and delivers detailed security findings for visibility and remediation.



### Example vulnerability
 - Unsafe account configuration practices such MFA not being enable for root user
 - SSH password enabled
 - Unresticted access to instance from the internet
